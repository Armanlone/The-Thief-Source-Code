# o Codes:
 This game utilizes "Singleton Pattern" in each gameObject's behaviour inside the scenes. Singletons are mostly used for sounds, game logics, level loadings, UIs, and other behaviours. But some gameObjects have independent logics that only applicable to them, like moving the player. Singleton Pattern was used to minimize the creation of new classes on each gameObject. And to have a clear programming architecture.
